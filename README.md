# STM32Drivers
This repository contain the source code for my next project. It contains the driver development for GPIO and I2C comminication running in a STM32F103C6T6A.

The interrupts for the GPIO is still on development, once I have faced issues for that. 

Currently IÂ´m working on the I2CMasterReceive function, which allows the master do receive data from the slave.
